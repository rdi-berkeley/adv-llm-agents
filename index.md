## Course Description

Large language model (LLM) agents have been an important frontier in AI, however, they still fall short critical skills, such as complex reasoning and planning, for solving hard problems and enabling end-to-end applications in real-world scenarios. Building on our [previous course](https://llmagents-learning.org/f24), this course dives deeper into advanced topics in LLM agents, focusing on reasoning, AI for mathematics, code generation, and program verification. We begin by introducing advanced inference and post-training techniques for building LLM agents that can search and plan. Then, we focus on two application domains: mathematics and programming. We study how LLMs can be used to prove mathematical theorems, as well as generate and reason about computer programs. Specifically, we will cover the following topics:
- Inference-time techniques for reasoning
- Post-training methods for reasoning
- Search and planning
- Agentic workflow, tool use, and functional calling
- LLMs for code generation and verification
- LLMs for mathematics: data curation, continual pretraining, and finetuning
- LLM agents for theorem proving and autoformalization

## Enrollment and Grading

***Prerequisites:*** **Students are strongly encouraged to have had experience and basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning before taking this class, e.g., have taken courses such as CS182, CS188, and CS189.**

***Please fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/sfWW8M2w1LDTnQWm9">petition form</a> if you are on the waitlist or can't get added to the waitlist.***

This is a variable-unit course. All enrolled students are expected to participate in lectures in person and complete weekly reading summaries related to the course content. Students enrolling in one unit are expected to submit an article that summarizes one of the lectures. Students enrolling in more than one unit are expected to submit a lab assignment and a project instead of the article.
For students enrolling in 2 units, the project should have a written report, which can be a survey in a certain area related to LLMs. For students enrolling in 3 or 4 units, projects will follow either an applications track or a research track:
 - Applications Track: Projects in this track focus on applied use cases of LLMs and do not necessarily need to contribute novel research. Students in this track will work in groups of 3-4. The project for 3-unit students should include an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, while 4-unit students must complete a more substantial implementation with the potential for real-world impact.
 - Research Track: Students in this track will conduct novel research under the supervision of postdocs and graduate students, with the goal of publishing in a workshop or conference. Research track projects must be completed in groups of 2-3, and students must apply to participate via a forthcoming Google form. The expectations for implementation and intellectual contributions will align with the project requirements for 3- and 4-unit students.
    
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                              | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Participation                | 40%    | 16%     | 8%        |
| Reading Summaries & Q/A      | 10%    | 4%      | 2%        |
| Quizzes                      | 10%    | 4%      | 2%        |
