This is a variable-unit course.
All enrolled students are expected to participate in lectures in person and complete weekly reading summaries related to the course content.
Students enrolling in one unit are expected to submit an article that summarizes one of the lectures.
Students enrolling in more than one unit are expected to submit a lab assignment and a project instead of the article.
The project of students enrolling in 2 units should have a written report, which can be a survey in a certain area related to LLMs.
The project of students enrolling in 3 units should also have an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, and the project of students enrolling in 4 units should have a very significant implementation component with the potential for either real world impacts or intellectual contributions.
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                              | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
